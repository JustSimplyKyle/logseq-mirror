- # Introduction to Participle Phrases
	- ## What it is
		- Allows you to combine two sentences without any prepositions or conjunctions.
		- For example:
			- He is a math genius, and he completed the test in less than 10 minutes.
		- Gets turned into:
			- **Being** a math genius, he completed the test in less than 10 minutes.
	- ## How to form it
		- If the two sentences subject are the same, omit one of them.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- remove the **conjunctions**.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- make the verb in the sentence which **the subjects are omitted** into **Ving/Ved** form depending on the words voice.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Voila, there you have it!
	- ## Example translations and pitfalls
		- ### Original Sentences
			- The scientist completed the experiment.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- He wrote a detailed report.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- ### Combined Sentences
			- The scientist **completed** the experiment, writing a detailed report.
		- Notice anything weird? Where has our **tense** gone? Let's add them back.
		- ### Combined Sentences(Modified)
			- **Having completed** the experiment, the scientist wrote a detailed report.
		- Using **present perfect** tense signifies that the former happens **before** than the latter.
