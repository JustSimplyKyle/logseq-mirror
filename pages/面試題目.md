- 1. Given a list of numbers, return an array that has those numbers squared.
  
  * C++
     1. Uses vector and traditional for loop
        1. Uses reserve -> 2 points
        2. Doesn't use reserve -> 1 point
     2. Uses vector and ranges for loop
        1. Uses reserve -> 3 points
        2. Doesn't use reserve -> 2 points
     3. Uses views transform -> 5 points
  
  * Python
     1. Uses list comprehension -> 3 points
     2. Doesn't use list comprehension -> 1 point
  
  2. Implement binary search on a sorted array.
  * C++: (Not specified in the diagram, but typically it would be something like this)
     1. Iterative approach -> 2 points
     2. Recursive approach -> 3 points
  
  * Python: (Not specified in the diagram)
  
  3. Check if a number is prime.
  * Python:
     1. Checks up to sqrt(n) -> 3 points
     2. Checks up to n-1 -> 2 points
  
  This structure captures the main elements of the Excalidraw diagram, including the different implementation approaches and their corresponding point allocations. The binary search question was implied in the diagram but didn't have specific scoring, so I've included a typical scoring system for it. The prime number checking question was only shown for Python in the diagram.
