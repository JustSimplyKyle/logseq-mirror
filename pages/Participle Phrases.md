# What it is
	- Allows you to combine two sentences without any prepositions or conjunctions.
	- For example:
		- He is a math genius, and he completed the test in less than 10 minutes.
	- Gets turned into:
		- **Being** a math genius, he completed the test in less than 10 minutes.
- # How to form it
	- If the two sentences subject are the same, omit one of them.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- remove the **conjunctions**.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- make the verb in the sentence which **the subjects are omitted** into **Ving/Ved** form depending on the words voice.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Voila, there you have it!
- # Example translations and pitfalls
	- ## Example with tense
		- ### Original Sentences
			- The scientist completed the experiment.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- He wrote a detailed report.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- ### Transformed Sentences
			- The scientist **completed** the experiment, writing a detailed report.
		- ### Notice any issues?
		- Notice anything weird? Where has our **tense** gone? Let's add them back.
		- ### Transformed Sentences(Modified)
			- **Having completed** the experiment, the scientist wrote a detailed report.
		- Using **present perfect** tense signifies that the former happens **before** than the latter.
	- ## Example with different subjects
		- ### Original Sentences
			- The teacher explained the lesson.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- The students understood the concept.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- ### Transformed sentences
			- **The teacher** having explained the lesson, **the students** understood the concept.
		- ### Notice
			- the subjects are **NOT** omitted, since they are different.
			- It is often to use the "present prefect tense" technique to emphasize ordering so as to avoid confusion.
	- ## Example with conditional sentence
		- ### Original Sentence
			- If the weather allows it, we’ll go to the picnic.
		- ### Transformed Sentence
			- **Weather allowing**, we’ll go to the picnic.
		- This utilizes the technique of merging different subject. Though it may seem weird at first, it is fully valid.
