- Man 雙語實驗班(BEXP) is not as great as I've initially thought
	- People are just not as great! they are so shy, and some of them, legitimately looks... not great to be friend with.
	- There are people who looks like bullies, or just passively aggressive people.
	- There are bad at english, which is a _wild_ thing to say in an BEXP!
		- and seems to be just for fun in High school.
	- The good part of course of the Teacher! and the courses do seem quite interesting and intriguing.
	- I thought self-learning is just a gimmick, but it does look like that that should be a true thing.
		- There are plans for helping you and stuff
- The clubs however... are an interesting issue
	- I know in my deep heart I want to join the 程式設計
	- but that just seems not fun! I'm not trying to be a dickhead but
		- _wow does those people not look intelligent_
		- well the nicer way to say this is, they have courses that does not fit that nicely to my needs.
	- I'll probably join 演辯社, since that should be fun.(and imagine ranting about stuff!! love it.)
