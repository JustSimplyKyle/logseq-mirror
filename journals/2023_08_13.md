- The Taichung trip is not as fun as I've hoped. Admittedly it was not anticipated by me at all! Thus I've completely stopped writing diaries during those days. The final day was especially tedious, the only thing we did is just picture after picture after picture! Altho the morning beef soup that day, damn is that something I admire.
