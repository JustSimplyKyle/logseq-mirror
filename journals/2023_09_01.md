- Today we met our three social studies teacher!!
  I think ALL of them are great
  Great in different ways also!
  Our
	- History
		- He is an informative guy, but speaks in a way that is... lack of a better way attractive.
	- Civic.
		- Wow is she interesting. She absolutely loves us discuss and rant(?
		  And having us to do a 2024 election PPT!
	- And well for geography, less interesting, but I can see she puts a lot of effort into teaching and trying to let us *understand*
