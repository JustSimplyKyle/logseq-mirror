			- The *albatross* is an exceedingly large seabird, having a wingspan as much as 11 feet across.
			  In Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s 1798 poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, the titular mariner kills an albatross that has been following his ship, bringing down a curse that leads to the **death** of all other crew members. As a punishment, the crew hang the **dead bird** from the mariner’s neck, and he remains alive to witness the ship’s fate **unfold**. This potent emblem led to the coining of a metaphorical meaning for albatross as something that causes anxiety or guilt or that burdens and encumbers.
